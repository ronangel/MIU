# MIU
My attempt at a solution to the MIU problem from the book Godel, Escher, Bach (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach). 

This looks like a neat little problem to test my TDD chops against.  

The MIU problem is descibed on Wikipedia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MU_puzzle

It turns out that there is no solution, which is what I had suspected after attempting to manually solve the problem. I was very careful during development not to peek at the solution on Wikipedia. Only after finishing the solution and attempting to run it (with a limit of 1M steps) did I learn that there appeared to be no solution. Of course, I had to confirm that online, in case my program was in correct.
